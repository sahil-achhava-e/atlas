/**
 * TRIGGERS — every way the floor gets woken up without a human typing, in one
 * tab. Four types (src/shared/triggers.ts is the contract): schedules, context,
 * webhooks and organisation. Schedules is the oldest and used to BE this tab.
 *
 * This panel is a sidebar, so four flat forms would open as a wall. Each type is
 * a collapsed card carrying its name, a one-line "what this is", and a live
 * summary chip; schedules opens expanded because it is the incumbent and the
 * office calendar deep-links here. Inside a card, each row collapses the same
 * way, so nothing is more than two disclosures from legible.
